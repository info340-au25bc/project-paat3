      <h2>What's the Problem?</h2>
      <p>
        The burden of gift giving weighs on many minds. Every birthday, family gathering, wedding, anniversary,
        graduation,
        or otherwise celebratory occasion calls for a special, tailored gift for that special someone, or perhaps it's
        just
        an acquaintance…Regardless of to whom a gift may be meant for, the ultimate problem is and remains to be, what
        should
        that perfect present be? Here, with this web application, take the person you have in mind, input the best parts
        of
        their personality, and our webpage will provide a comprehensive list of perfect present options.
        In the dreadful occupation of gift-giving, there is an oversaturation of information technology. From niche
        websites,
        to the Amazon galaxy, to in-person shopping, to second-hand Facebook Marketplace, gift-giving often leads down a
        rabbit
        hole of overstimulation, confusion, and dissatisfaction. By centralizing the best options in the gift-giving
        world, from
        useful gadgets or everyday appliances, to unique trinkets and specialized gifts, this webpage will centralize
        data and
        ensure a delightful user experience.

      <h2>Then What's the Solution?</h2>
      <p>A Gifter's Compass is the solution to everyone's gift-giving qualms. By centralizing the best options in the
        never-ending,
        consumerist gift-giving world this webpage will centralize all that data and ensure a delightful user
        experience. From
        useful gadgets or everyday appliances, to unique trinkets and specialized gifts, A Gifter's Compass will lead
        you to find
        that perfect gift for any person, any ocassion. The features we seek to implement are:
      <p> <strong>1. Personalized Gift Quiz & Recommendation System: </strong> A guided, interactive quiz that collects
        key information
        about the
        gift recipient (e.g., personality, interests, age, relationship to the user). Based on these inputs, the system
        will instantly generate a tailored list of gift recommendations, streamlining the search for the perfect item.
      </p>
      <p> <strong>2. User Gift Library & Management: </strong> Users can save recommended or browsed items into a
        personal, organized
        "Gift Library." This library can be viewed and filtered by categories like the specific occasion and intended
        recipient. </p>
      <p> <strong>3. General Browse and Discovery Page: </strong> A standard discovery feature that allows users to
        explore and browse
        gifts using
        traditional filters such as category, price range, and store/brand. This feature complements the quiz by
        providing
        an option for general exploration.</p>

        <h2>What Makes A Gifter's Compass Different?</h2>
        <p>
          Other existing applications and websites offer gift-related service such as streamlining the delivery
          of curated gift boxes or harnessing AI to suggest gifts quickly. While various services
          for the gift service exist, current options offer limited input on the recipient's personality,
          interests, or deeper context.
        </p>
        <p>
          What makes A Gifter's Compass different is its individualization. Its care for the
          receipient. This compass is more than a gift finder — it;s a guided discovery tool
          that helps givers navigate gifting with intention. It's not just about what to give
          — it's about why it fits.
